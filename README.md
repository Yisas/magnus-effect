The following resources were used for the development of this project.

[`Glitter`](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter), a simple boilerplate for OpenGL that compiles and statically links every required library, listed below.  
_Note: the `bullet` physics library which ships as part of `Glitter` is taken out of this repository, as the goal of this project is to create a physics simulation through our own means._
